1. [APIController] 

=> we are not required to metion in the parameter [FromBody], where we are getting data
ApiController Attribute handles it.

=> ApiController will NOT work if data is comming from BODY(Postman/Client) and it is not in a single object
ex. string username,string password in the BODY will not be recognized. Rather Object need to be used which container username and pass.

=> Do validation of Models using Attributes : [Requied] etc.

2. SingleOrDefault Vs. FirstOrDefault

=> SingleOrDefault also throw expection rest same
